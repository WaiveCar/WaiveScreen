When doing physical installs this is my checklist:
* 2 USB keyboards
* 2 USB hubs with as much of a low clearance connector $10 will get you
* 1 Mirror compact from the dollar store
* 1 Flashlight (phone is fine)
* 2 USB install media
* 1 Laptop to make new installmedia (really, really, nice to have)
* 1 Phillips screw driver (J0/J1 is fine). My fave is the [ORIA Precision Screwdriver Kit](https://www.amazon.com/ORIA-Screwdriver-Professional-Precision-Smartphone/dp/B01E16J6RQ)
* 1 Key to unlock the screens (Any small pokey tool or narrow flat thing will work, but the proper key is always best)
* Extra SIM cards
* Extra antennae
* Extra SATA DOMs
